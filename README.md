# Implementation-of-Immutable-ADTs-for-Time-Conceptions

• Implemented simple immutable ADTs for three conceptions of time: Duration, Time, and Period.
• Developed the Duration ADT to represent a non-negative amount of time with operations such as addition, subtraction, scaling,
and division.
• Implemented the Time ADT to represent a point in historical time, allowing operations like time difference, addition, and
subtraction.
• Designed the Period ADT to represent an extent of historical time with methods to retrieve start and stop times, length, and
check for overlap.
• Followed best practices for immutable ADTs, overriding standard methods like equals, hashCode, and toString.
• Utilized JUnit test cases to ensure the correctness and functionality of the implemented ADTs.
